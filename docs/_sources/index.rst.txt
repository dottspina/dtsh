DTSh Project Documentation
##########################

**DTSh** is a Devicetree Source (`DTS <DTSpec-DTS_>`_) files viewer
with a shell-like command line interface:

- *navigate* and *visualize* the devicetree
- *search* for devices, bindings, buses or interrupts with flexible criteria
- redirect command output to files (text, HTML, SVG) to *document* hardware configurations
  or illustrate notes
- *rich* Textual User Interface, command line auto-completion, command history, user themes

You can use it with:

- all DTS files generated by **Zephyr** at build-time (aka `build/zephyr/zephyr.dts`)
- arbitrary DTS files with bindings compatible with Zephyr's
  `Devicetree bindings syntax <Zephyr-Binding Syntax_>`_

Status
******

Welcome to the DTSh Projectâ€™s documentation for the ``dtsh-next`` branch.
This branch mirrors and packages the code base that serves as a proposal to upstream DTSh
as a new `Zephyr extension to West <Zephyr-West_>`_ (would be ``west dtsh``):
`RFC - DTSh, shell-like interface with Devicetree <DTSh-RFC_>`_

Source code and documentation for the Proof of Concept and prototype (DTSh 0.1.x) are still
available at the ``main`` `branch <DTSh-main_>`_ of this repository.

*Latest release*: **0.2.2** `Release Notes <https://github.com/dottspina/dtsh/releases/tag/v0.2.2>`_
(`PyPI <PyPI-dtsh_>`_)
