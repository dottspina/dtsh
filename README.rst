**dtsh** is an interactive *shell-like* interface with a devicetree and
its bindings:

-  browse the devicetree through a familiar hierarchical file-system
   metaphor
-  retrieve nodes and bindings with accustomed command names and command
   line syntax
-  generate simple documentation artifacts by redirecting commands
   output to files (text, HTML, SVG)
-  common command line interface paradigms (auto-completion, history)
   and keybindings

This software was created as a Proof of Concept for a
simple tool that could assist newcomers to Zephyr in understanding
what a devicetree is, and how bindings describe and constrain its
content.
