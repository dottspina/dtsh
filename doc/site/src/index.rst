DTSh Project Documentation
##########################

**DTSh** is a Devicetree Source (`DTS <DTSpec-DTS_>`_) files viewer
with a shell-like command line interface:

- *navigate* and *visualize* the devicetree
- *search* for devices, bindings, buses or interrupts with flexible criteria
- redirect command output to files (text, HTML, SVG) to *document* hardware configurations
  or illustrate notes
- *rich* Textual User Interface, command line auto-completion, command history, user themes

You can use it with:

- all DTS files generated by **Zephyr** at build-time (aka `build/zephyr/zephyr.dts`)
- arbitrary DTS files with bindings compatible with Zephyr's
  `Devicetree bindings syntax <Zephyr-Binding Syntax_>`_
